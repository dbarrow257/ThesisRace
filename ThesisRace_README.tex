/data/t2k/dealtry/RAL_repoisitory/t2k/tdealtry/thesis/thesiscount

a couple of aliases

alias thesiscount='cd $RALREPO/tdealtry/thesis/thesiscount; renameshell thesiscount; ./countthesis.sh; tail thesiscount_tom.txt'

alias thesiscountnow='$RALREPO/tdealtry/thesis/thesiscount/texcount.pl -inc -total -sum thesis.tex; tail -n 1 $RALREPO/tdealtry/thesis/thesiscount/thesiscount_tom.txt'

alias thesiscount='cd /home/duffy/Thesis/ThesisRace; renameshell thesiscount; ./countthesis.sh; tail thesiscount_kirsty.txt'

alias thesiscountnow='/home/duffy/Thesis/ThesisRace/texcount.pl -inc -total -sum /home/duffy/Thesis/thesismain.tex; tail -n 1 /home/duffy/Thesis/ThesisRace/thesiscount_kirsty.txt'

it's currently setup for svn, but cvs commands are there commented out

and git won't be too difficult to add

And other things to change (from an old email from Abbey)

You'll need to change this line:

makecounts abbey contrib/waldron/thesis thesis.tex 2012-01-03

the second argument is the path in the cvs repository where your thesis
is, the third the main thesis file and the fourth the start date.  Also,
in the same directory, you'll need to edit plot_thesis_count.C to make
it read in your count and plot it, and maybe you want to copy the page
in my public_html/plots directory so you get both plots on the same
page.

(I guess you could procrastinate by writing a README)
